package com.example.opennhsscot

/*
Simple App designed to develop Dependency Injection, Retrofit and JSON to Kotlin Model development skills.

App accesses NHS Scotland open access data set and displays list of local GP practices with list size.

User can search for practices over a specified list size.

Was going to add button to get all via myVM.fetchGpData() but not used in favour of user search.

NHS Scotland site is https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/about

From their site -

'The Scottish Health and Social Care open data platform gives access to statistics and reference data for information and re-use.
This platform is managed by Public Health Scotland.
Data is released under the UK Open Government Licence (OGL) which means it is free to use and re-use.'
